ADMIN
1. Leaving the password blank grants access to any account
2. The credentials are in plaintext in the cookie, easily hackable
3. After editing a user password, attempting to add new users changes the current user's password instead

PURCHASE FUNNEL
1. Quantity input allows negative numbers, for a negative subtotal (and a refund?)
2. American Express cards are not validated correctly; they are validated like Visa cards
3. 13-digit Visa cards are not accepted despite being valid
4. When no expiration date is entered, the message reads "Card is expired", not "No expiration date"

MISC:
1. The copyright date is wrong
2. The login is the most obvious call to action on every page
